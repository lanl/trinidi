Generation of Simulated Data
----------------------------
To generate the simulated data we use `TRINIDI`'s `generate_sample_data` function that generates
a phantom of overlapping discs of different isotopes and the associated measurement counts.

Below we define what isotopes to use for the phantom and what their corresponding densities, `z`
should become. The `projection_shape` is 2D and is the the size of the detector, but in general it
can be of any dimensionality.

Preparation for the Reconstruction
----------------------------------

For the reconstruction we need to define the regions `Ω_z` and `Ω_0` that correspond to the so
called uniformly dense region and the open beam region, respectively.

For this we use the `ProjectionRegion` class. We initialize each with a mask (boolean array) that
has shape `projection_shape + (1,)`, indicating which pixels belong to these regions.

In this example we use the ground truth `Z` to find these regions as
 - the overlap of all discs: Ω_z
 - the complement of the union of all discs: Ω_0.

(In the general case when the ground truth is not known, the user will have to find a way to define
these regions such as through prior knowledge about where to adequately find such regions.)

Reconstruction of the Nuisance Parameters
-----------------------------------------
The nuisance parameters are computed first before the densities can be computed. They parametrize
such quantities associated the the neutron flux and background at every pixel (Φ, B) and global
scalers such as the overall relative exposure and sample induced background factors (α_1, α_2). We
do not expect the general user to need to understand these parameters intricately and thus the
handling of these parameters is encapsulated inside the `ParameterEstimator` object.

Cropped or Binned Measurements

In practice, it is not always desired to reconstruct the full field of view or at full resolution:
Perhaps we require the full field of view to estimate the nuisance parameters, but
we only want to reconstruct a small cropped region.
For this reason we can provide the `projection_transform` argument in the `DensityEstimator`
constructor.

The `projection_transform` is the desired operation that is applied to the measurements and used
internally to handle the modification of the background and flux estimates.
